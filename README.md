 Founders and Coders Application Website

### Project overview

This website is my (Cemal Okten) application for the Founders and Coders (FAC) 2021 Autumn Cohort. I designed it to  fullfill the requirements set by FAC. I also wanted to create a website from scratch using the HTML, CSS and JavaScript and have learnt over the past few months. It also gave me an oppertunity to put into words why I want to learn more   about coding and my journey in life so far.
