            <p>
                Hi, my name is Cemal <i>(Je-mal)(he/him)</i>, I live in South London with my
                <span class="number" data-id="1">partner</span> and our
                dog <span class="number" data-id="2">Bobby</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                My father is from Turkey and my Mother is from London. I grew up on a
                council estate and left for London to study 3D Design in 2006. After
                graduating I started working as an assistant at a design studio making
                furniture.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since then I have worked as a designer for over 10 years, I‚Äôve
                designed and made

                <span class="number" data-id="3">interiors</span>,
                <span class="number" data-id="4">sculptures</span>
                for Turner Prize winners and most recently Sunglasses that were worn
                by Rita Ora (so proud).
            </p>

            <p>I have also had the opportunity to plan and teach twice yearly workshops at Bath Spa University with 1st
                and 2nd Year 3D
                students, which I have really loved.</p>

            <p>During that time I have often been at odds with what I do, wanting to create inclusive things to help
                people, but
                instead creating exclusive things for wealthy people. Teaching was a breath of fresh air.</p>

            <p>The global pandemic happened and then lockdown and with that the loss of my part-time job and (very)
                small sunglasses
                business. No longer sure of anything, I started to explore the things that I used to love before life
                got in the way. I
                researched and talked to alot of people and finally I remembered the thrill of making a piece of code
                work and seeing it
                transform a webpage in front of my eyes, something I hadn't done since I was 15.</p>

            <p>And here I am, after a very difficult but transformative year, I have come to terms with no longer
                wanting to be a
                designer, being a beginner again and embracing everything I can. I have realised that I love to create
                things, whether
                it's from a piece of wood or lines of code. I am applying to the Founders and Coders in the hope I can
                learn, make a
                difference and together make a world we are all happy to live in.</p>

        <section id="section--three">
            <h2 class="title--main">values and beliefs</h2>
            <p>I want to live in a world which is inclusive, not exclusive, where being different is celebrated. I want
                to create
                things that help other people.
            </p>

        <section id="section--four">
            <h2 class="title--main">Why Coding?</h2>
            <p>When I was young my Dad showed me how to create a simple webpage in Dreamweaver. The realisation that I
                could link one
                page to another was amazing. From there I taught myself HTML and CSS by looking at the source code of
                other sites I
                liked, which is still my favorite way to understand how things work, by breaking them apart and trying
                to put them back
                together.</p>
            <p>
                I love solving problems
                I love creating something from nothing
                If I can imagine it then I can (hopefully) build it
                I like to work as a team and coding is all about collaboration</p>
            <p>
                With coding, even when you know how something works, it can still feel like magic.
            </p>

        <section id="section--five">
            <h2 class="title--main">Why FAC?</h2>
            <p>Peer led. From experience teaching, working together is always better than alone.</p>
            <p>Community. For so long I have wanted to be part of something bigger than myself, part of a community that
                supports and
                includes everyone.</p>
            <p>Diverse and Inclusive. I've always felt a little bit between,and by that I mean not quite enough, not
                quite Turkish
                enough, not quite English enough. I struggle to know how to describe or label myself; a name that almost
                everyone
                struggles to say and assumes I am foreign, a voice and appearance that people assume I am English.
                Founders and Coders
                feels like a place where it's ok to be different, to be between.</p>
