### Project overview

This website is my (Cemal Okten) application for the Founders and Coders (FAC) 2021 Autumn Cohort. I designed it to  fullfill the requirements set by FAC. I also wanted to create a website from scratch using the HTML, CSS and JavaScript I have learnt over the past few months, it also taught me alot more! It gave me an oppertunity to put into words why I want to learn more about coding and a join the FAC Autumn cohort. 🍁

- Use sticky CSS positioning for headers
- Background colour changes depending on section
- Images appear over text to add context to words
- Random colours applied to links background so website feels different each time
- Greeting to welcome to user
- Screensaver with time and location
- Keyboard down and up to jump to next section
