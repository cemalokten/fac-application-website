            <h2 class="section--title" data-section="section1">About Me</h2>
            <p>
                ‚úãüèº Hi, my name is <span class="link" data-id="1">Cemal</span> <i>(Je-mal) (he/him)</i>, I live in South
                London with my <span class="link" data-id="2">partner</span> and our dog <span class="link" data-id="3">Bobby</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have two amazing <span class="link" data-id="4">sisters</span>, our Mum is originally from London and our Dad is a 
                political exile from Turkey. We grew up on a council estate and I moved to London to study Product Design in 2006. 
                After graduating I started working as an assistant making <span class="link" data-id="5">furniture</span> üî®.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since then I have worked as a designer, I have also had the opportunity to teach twice yearly design
                <span class="link" data-id="6">workshops</span> at Bath Spa University, which I really loved.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have often felt very stuck, wanting to create inclusive things to help people, but instead creating
                exclusive things that didn't really help anyone. Teaching was a breath of <span class="link" data-id="7">fresh air</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The global pandemic hit and with that I lost my job. After going through a breakdown I decided it was time to get unstuck. 
                I started to explore the things that I used to love before life got in the way. 
                I remembered the rush of making a piece of code work, something I hadn't done since <span class="link" data-id="8">I was 13</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                And here I am, after a very difficult but transformative year, I have come to terms with no longer
                wanting to be a designer, being a beginner again and embracing everything I can. I love to create things 
                and be creative, whether it's with planks of wood üå≤ or lines of code üíª.

        <section id="section--two" data-title="Why Coding?">
            <h2 class="section--title" data-section="section2">Why Coding?</h2>
            <p>
                <li>‚Üí I love solving problems</li>
                <li>‚Üí I love creating things</li>
                <li>‚Üí I love to learn new things</li>
                <li>‚Üí I love to collaborate and work as team</li>
            </p>
            <p>
                When I was younger my Dad showed me how to create a simple webpage in
                <span class="link" data-id="9">Dreamweaver</span>. Discovering I could link one page to another was
                amazing ü§Ø. After that I taught myself the basics of HTML and CSS by looking at the source code of other 
                sites I liked. I created lots of small sites which were based on computer <span class="link" data-id="10">games</span> 
                I liked at the time.
            </p>
            <p>
                With coding, even when you know how something works, it can still feel like <span id="wizard">üßôüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</span> magic.

        <section id="section--three" data-title="Why FAC?">
            <h2 class="section--title" data-section="section3">Why FAC?</h2>

            <p>Computers and the internet have always been a bit of a refuge for me, giving me new ways of thinking and opportunities
            which I wouldn't have had otherwise.</p>
            <p>To be part of Founders and Coders would be an opportunity to shape the future and give others those same opportunities.
            To create a future which is more diverse, more inclusive and genuinely a better place. I want to be part of this future.
            </p>
            <p>Peer led ‚Üí I really look forward to working collaboratively to help each other, to share experiences and to have the chance to see
            things from someone else's perspective. Talking something through with a friend or peer always helps me understand and realise new
            things.
            </p>
            <p>
            Community-based ‚Üí For so long I have wanted to be part of something bigger than myself, part of a group working towards
            a common goal that supports and includes everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
            Diverse and inclusive ‚Üí I've always felt a bit between, not quite enough. Not quite Turkish enough, not quite British
            enough. I struggle to know how to describe or label myself; I have a name that almost everyone struggles to say or spell; a name
            that instantly marks me out and makes others assume I am ‚Äòforeign‚Äô, but my accent and appearance means people assume I am British. 
            Founders and Coders feels like a place where it's OK (great, even) to be different, to be between.
